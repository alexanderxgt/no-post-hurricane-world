# THERE IS NO POST HURRICANE WORLD

## Acknowledgment
This project is dedicated to the people of Puerto Rico, who rose in protest in the Summer of 19 to demand better governance and persevere in the long shadow of that faithful September 2017 night. We hope they find The Post Hurricane World they deserve. 

## Abstract 
We sought to determine whether natural disasters permanently changed the socioeconomic trajectory of countries by data mining the World Development Indicators and the Emergency Disaster Database. Exploratory Data Analysis suggested that this is not necessarily the case. We found only one country where a natural disaster changed its socioeconomic trajectory: Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017. After this discovery, we focused on Puerto Rico and tasked ourselves with finding which areas of social and economic development were permanently affected by Hurricane Maria in the American territory. We designed a data pipeline to systematically mine our database and uncover Development Indicators that were permanently affected by Maria. We found that Maria negatively and permanently affected the following areas of socioeconomic development in the Commonwealth: 

1.	Food Production and Nutrition
2.	Public Sentiment 
3.	Energy 
4.	Education
5.	Economic Productivity 

These findings suggest that—indeed—there is no post hurricane world in Puerto Rico. The Commonwealth struggles to recover across key areas of social and economic development, 7 years after Maria. While these findings point towards a somber future for the American territory, they also offer local and federal leaders actionable areas in which to focus recovery efforts.

## Application of Findings 

Our key findings suggest that there is no post hurricane world in Puerto Rico. 7 years after Maria, the Commonwealth struggles to recover across 5 crucial areas of socioeconomic development. While these findings point towards a somber future for the American territory, they also offer local and federal leaders actionable areas in which to focus recovery efforts. 

We believe that the dynamics outlined in previous sections compound each other, and that unraveling a decades-long tangled web of problems requires closing the biggest wound first. Puerto Rico must fix its outdated, dirty, and inefficient power grid. After all, many of the struggles we documented trace back to the historic blackout that followed Maria’s arrival to Puerto Rico.
